Version 1.2
- All tree are now prepared as UNITREE prefabs with full support glosines, tranculency, normal maps and they are responsible to the wind
- 5 new materials with texture for bark
- 2 new materials with texture for leafs

Version 1.1
- This pack contains five tropical palm trees, ideal for any island oasis setting.
- The textures are imported at 512x1024 to speed up the import process, but the original files are 1024x2048 and can be re-imported at that size for higher quality.
- Palms are standart imported with one material (generation per texture) but models had prepared two materials - bark and leafs. If You need, simple reimport with per material generation.
- New AlphaTest-DiffuseDoubleSide.shader wich alow use palms as soliter static mesh models with lightmap.
- The model mesh has prepared two mapping coordinates. One for the diffuse map and one for the light map. Coordinates were made manually for best quality.
